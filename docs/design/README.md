# Design

Design notes for Crude. Some documents are aspirational; treat the OpenAPI spec and conformance suite as the source of truth for current behavior.

- Protocol contract (today): `protocol-contract.md`
- Conformance suite (Hurl): `conformance.md`
- Codegen workflows: `codegen-workflows.md`
- Multi-language implementations: `multi-language-implementations.md`
- Plugin system notes: `plugin-system.md`
- Meta-circular reflection: `meta-circularity.md`
