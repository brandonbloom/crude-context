Short definitions for cross-repo terms. Prefer these meanings when writing docs or implementing features.

- **Domain**: A scoped namespace representing a data source or application vocabulary (examples: github, os, debug).
- **Collection**: A named set of homogeneous elements within a domain.
- **Element**: A keyed item within a collection.
- **Key**: The identifier for an element within a collection (unique within that collection).
- **Resource**: An HTTP-addressable entity (domain/collection/element/etc.).
- **Content endpoint**: Endpoint that returns the natural representation of a collection/element; negotiated via `Accept`.
- **Format**: A representation/media type for content; may be enumerated as resources.
- **Organizer**: A hierarchical navigation structure for UI or filesystem-like browsing.
- **Ref string**: A compact string used by organizer entries to reference targets (example: `collection:alphabet`).
- **Search**: Query API returning heterogeneous results with relevance scoring.
- **Filter**: Query parameter used to restrict element listings; semantics described in docs, syntax may vary by client.
- **Cursor**: Opaque pagination token returned as `next` and passed back to continue listing.
- **Problem Details**: Standardized error payload (`application/problem+json`) used for errors like 404s.
- **OpenAPI spec**: The canonical HTTP contract; generated by `crude-openapi` and consumed by clients/servers.
- **Meta-spec**: The higher-level type definitions in `crude-openapi/src/spec/*` used to generate the OpenAPI spec.
- **Conformance suite**: The shared protocol-level regression tests (`crude-openapi/src/tests/hurl/*.hurl`).
- **Trunk development**: Mainline development model; release/publishing policies may vary by ecosystem.
